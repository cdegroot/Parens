This is an experiment based on http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf - the Lisp 1.5 manual. 

I never really learned Lisp, and the only times I sorta used it was in Emacs and in the SGMLtools project (where DSSL was the style sheet language). It seems sorta fun to implement the code from the book, as faithfully as possible, requiring an Mexp and an Sexp parsers. 

As I also suck in parsers and interpreters/compilers, I'm using Scala because Scala's Parser Combinators make the process at least halfway bearable :). 

This is on Github for convenience, but meant purely as an academic exercise for my own pleasure.
